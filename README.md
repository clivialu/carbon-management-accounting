## In plain language

This study explores how collaboration among stakeholders inside and outside organizations affects how firms manage and account for carbon emissions.  
We find that both internal coordination (e.g., between sustainability and finance teams) and external partnerships (e.g., with regulators, suppliers, or industry groups) shape the effectiveness of carbon management accounting systems.  
Firms that build structured stakeholder arrangements and share sustainability knowledge across boundaries tend to achieve more consistent, strategic, and transparent approaches to carbon management.
