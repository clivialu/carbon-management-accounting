## In Plain Language

This study explores how collaboration among stakeholders inside and outside organizations affects how firms manage and account for carbon emissions.  
We find that both internal coordination (e.g., between sustainability and finance teams) and external partnerships (e.g., with regulators, suppliers, or industry groups) shape the effectiveness of carbon management accounting systems.  
Firms that build structured stakeholder arrangements and share sustainability knowledge across boundaries tend to achieve more consistent, strategic, and transparent approaches to carbon management.

## Paper Highlight: 
| # | Why it matters | What the paper delivers |
|---|---------------|-------------------------|
| **1** | Companies need hard evidence that working with partners really lowers emissions. | Using 862 US firm-years of CDP data, the study shows that external stakeholder alliances (inter-organizational) and internal multi-functional projects (intra-organizational) each drive significant GHG reductions.|
| **2** | Not all collaborations are created equal. | Only transformational (deep, joint-decision) partnerships improve performance; transactional or transitional ties alone don’t. |
| **3** | Boards ask “does disclosure pay?” | Reveals a two-way, positive loop between comprehensive CDP reporting and later emissions results, using a 3SLS model that corrects endogeneity. |
| **4** | Where inside the firm should carbon efforts sit? | Demonstrates that a broader spread of reduction initiatives across processes, products & organisational systems lifts performance. |
| **5** | Evidence is strongest where stakes are highest. | In carbon-intensive industries (energy, mining, manufacturing) both overall stakeholder engagement and transformational ties become even more potent. |

### Managerial Takeaways

* **Invest in transformational engagement.** Cultivate a few deep, co-creative alliances (e.g., joint technology pilots) rather than many loose memberships; these deliver the biggest emissions gains. 
* **Mobilise cross-functional teams.** Spread carbon initiatives across engineering, finance, supply, product and HR—the wider the footprint, the steeper the performance lift. 
* **Use disclosure as a management tool, not a marketing chore.** Detailed CDP/GRI reporting forms a feedback loop that sharpens future performance targets and action plans. 
* **Prioritise intensive partnerships in carbon-heavy sectors.** Energy, extraction and heavy manufacturing reap outsized benefits from stakeholder collaborations—allocate resources accordingly. 
* **Blend external and internal capabilities.** Firms that excel at both stakeholder collaboration and internal integration achieve superior, report-verified results—the paper calls this the “external–internal learning triangle.”
